In .hack, you played as a teenager playing a massively multiplayer online game, so every time you started the PlayStation 2 game you saw the desktop of Altimit OS, where you could launch applications for reading your email, checking the news, and more.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was all very meta, and I was hooked. As a tribute to the game, I decided to make a nearly pixel-perfect clone of the interface in Love2D, a Lua based game engine. There was so much code involved to make this happen, but I also had to rip the original game data from the game disc, hand-design the rotating 3D icons using Google Sketchup, and reformat all the data so it could be presented in Love2D.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, it has been so long since I worked on it that my copy of the source code is incomplete, and is built for a old version of Love2D that I still can't find.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here's a video of it in action:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3UNy9XUmPM4\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>And here's a snapshot of the 3D assets I created:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"3D Altimit OS icons\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"c2931987-1b06-4c5c-8469-cdcfa258b364\" src=\"\/sites\/default\/files\/inline-images\/altimitos_icons.jpg\" \/><\/p>\r\n",
