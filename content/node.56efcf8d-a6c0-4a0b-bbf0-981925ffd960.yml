      <p>After creating <a href="/work/tome">Tome</a>, I realized that the two most common requests for static sites would be form submissions (covered by many third parties) and search. Search on a static site is usually done with AJAX, sometimes to a third party or something like Solr. I did some research and found the <a href="https://lunrjs.com/">Lunr</a> project, which was advertised as a lightweight client-side alternative to Solr.</p>

      <p>Lunr lets you generate a search index, either at runtime or before hand, which the client then loads and uses to perform fuzzy searches. I created a Drupal integration for Lunr in the form of a module that provides an easy way to take data from a View and use it to generate an index, in addition to having a dedicated page to search through those results.</p>

      <p>The fun part of this for me is that so much of the code is in JavaScript - Drupal handles the view and Lunr search index configuration, but the user interface for searching is completely client side. If you want to learn more about the project, your can <a href="/blog/static-searches-drupal-and-lunr">read the blog post</a>. You can also try out the search on this site at <a href="/search">/search</a>.</p>
